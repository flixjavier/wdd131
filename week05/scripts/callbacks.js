/* sort() Method in JavaScript
The sort() method in JavaScript is used to sort the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array. The default sorting order is according to string Unicode code point */

/* Natural Order Sorting (Default Behavior)
When you call sort() without a compare function, it sorts the elements as strings. This means that even if your array contains numbers, they will be treated as strings and sorted character by character. */

const nums2 = [1, 20, 10, 22, 30, 44, 100, 11];
console.log(nums2.sort());

/* In this example:

The number 1 is considered as the string "1".
The number 20 is considered as the string "20".
"1" is compared with "20", and so on.
When compared as strings, "10" comes before "100" because the first character ("1") is the same, but "0" comes before "0". Similarly, "11" comes after "10" but before "20". */


/* Custom Sorting with Compare Function
To sort numbers in a numerical order (either ascending or descending), you need to provide a compare function to the sort() method.
 */

//array.sort(compareFunction)
//Ascending

console.log(nums2.sort((a,b) => a-b));

/* a - b compares two numbers.
If a is less than b, the result is negative, so a comes before b.
If a is equal to b, the result is zero, so their order doesn't change.
If a is greater than b, the result is positive, so a comes after b. */

//Descending

console.log(nums2.sort((a,b)=>b-a));

/* reduce()
It executes a reducer method on each element of array and results in a single value. */

//Example â€” 1: Sum of array elements

let output = nums.reduce((accumulator,currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue);
console.log(output);

/* Call   accum currentValue return */
/* first    1          2         3     */
/* second   3          3         6     */
/* third    6          4         10     */
/* forth    10         5         15     */

/* Observe the execution figure, In the first call first value is considered as accumulator and iteration starts from second value.

From the second call whatever the return value is stored in the accumulator and the next value is picked as the current value. */


/* Example 3: Tallying Votes */

const votes = ['y', 'y', 'n', 'y', 'n', 'n', 'n'];
const result3 = votes.reduce((tally, vote) => {
   tally[vote] = (tally[vote] || 0) + 1;
   return tally;
}, {}); // Initial value: {}
console.log(result3); // {y: 3, n: 4}

/* Explanation:

Initial Setup:

The reduce() method is used to tally the votes in the votes array.
The reduce() method takes two arguments: a callback function and an initial value for the accumulator.
Callback Function:

The callback function in this example is (tally, vote) => { tally[vote] = (tally[vote] || 0) + 1; return tally; }.
tally is the accumulator that holds the tally of votes so far.
vote is the current element (vote) being processed in the array.
Tallying Votes:

tally[vote] = (tally[vote] || 0) + 1 checks if tally[vote] is already defined.
If tally[vote] is undefined (i.e., the vote hasn't been tallied yet), it defaults to 0.
It then increments the count of the vote by 1.
Iteration:

The iteration starts with an empty object {} as the initial tally.
For each vote in the votes array, it updates the tally object with the count of each vote type ('y' or 'n').
Result:

After iterating through the entire array, tally holds the counts of each vote type.
The result is { y: 3, n: 4 }, indicating there are 3 'y' votes and 4 'n' votes. */
